  <p>
    The Client-Edge-Cloud coordination Community Group provides a forum for global community to discuss, incubate, and
    propose Client-Edge-Cloud coordination related use cases, workload-offloading mechanisms and standard ideas.
  </p>
  <h2 id="background">
    Background
  </h2>


  <p>
    With the rapid development of cloud computing technology, the centralized cloud is evolving towards a distributed
    "edge cloud". An edge cloud allows developers to deploy their code using Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) close to the
    user's location. As new technologies like machine learning and IoT become increasingly integrated into client-side
    applications, client side applications may also need to perform computing intensive work. For example, machine
    learning inference can also be done on the client side.
  </p>

  <p>
    To improve the client side application's performance, there is a trend to offload computing intensive work to the
    edge cloud, including such approaches as cloud apps, cloud gaming etc. However, the current approach could be
    further optimized if there existed a mechanism for Client-Edge-Cloud coordination.
  </p>

  <p>The group draft note, titled <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/edge-cloud-reqs/">Client-Edge-Cloud coordination Use
      Cases and Requirements</a>, published by Web & Networks Interest Group, has conducted some exploratory work on the
    use cases, requirements and potential architecture proposals. However, comments from <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2023/09/11-web-networks-minutes.html#t02">TPAC 2023</a> showed that it still
    needs further input from the outside of the interest group to enhance the use cases, requirements and architecture
    proposals.
  </p>

  <P>
    This community group is created to broaden the input, enhance the use casese and requirements, provide
    architecture proposals  and API interfaces.
  </P>
  </p>


  <h2 id="scope">
    Scope of Work
  </h2>
  <p>Client-Edge-Cloud coordination Community Group aims to discuss proposals for Client-Edge-Cloud coordination,
    including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use cases and requirements for Client-Edge-Cloud coordination;</li>
    <li>Architecture proposals for workload offloading;</li>
    <li>Designing a set of new APIs and mechanism that enable computing workload offloading.</li>
    <li>Secure networking and trust model requirements in the context of edge computing and offload to edge.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="nonscope">
    Out of Scope
  </h2>
  <p>
    The group does not intend to develop new standards for Client-Edge-Cloud coordination.
  </p>

  <h2 id="success-criteria">Success Criteria </h2>
  <p>
    The Community Group will have succeeded if it can achieve the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Participation from various stakeholder communities, especially from startup, innovators in the space of
      distributed computing;</li>
    <li>Definition of use cases, technical requirements;</li>
    <li>A standard solution architecture for workload offloading.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
  <p>
    The Community Group will have the followin deliverables:
  <ul>
    <li>Use cases and corresponding technical requirements</li>
    <li>Proposed standard solution architecture for workload offloading
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="coordination">
    Coordination
  </h2>
  <p>
    It is anticipated that the group will collaborate with appropriate W3C Working Groups in order to transition spec
    proposals to the Recommendation or Living Standard track. This group will probably get into collaboration with the
    following groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web & Networks Interest Group Charter</li>
    <li>Web Performance Working Group</li>
    <li>Web Real-Time Communications Working Group</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="process">
    Community and Business Group Process and Patent Policy
  </h2>
  <p>
    The group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms of in this charter that conflict with those of
    the Community and Business Group Process are void.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
    commitments under the <a href='http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a> (Proposals in this Community
    Group charter are applicable "Specification" in the CLA). When people
    request to participate without representing their organization’s legal
    interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with
    the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
    commitment under the CLA starting with the individual’s first request to
    make a contribution to a group deliverable. The section on <a href="#participation-and-contribution">Contribution
      Mechanics</a> describes how W3C expects to
    monitor these contribution requests.
  </p>

  <h2 id="decision">
    Decision Policy
  </h2>
  <p>
    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section
      5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined
    in
    discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being
    required.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of
    the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
  </p>

  <p>
    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions)
    taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be
    issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to
    10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are
    raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as
    a resolution of the Interest Group.
  </p>

  <p>
    All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or
    unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C
      Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes
    no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
